# Hi there, I'm Luis 👋

🛰️ **Aerospace Engineering student** with a strong interest in  
aerodynamics, numerical methods and Python-based tooling.

I enjoy coding whatever piques my interest, usually in the embedded or numerical commputation realms.

## 🧰 Tech & Toolset

- **Languages:** Python, MATLAB, embedded C/C++ 
- **Python stack:** NumPy, Matplotlib, (Plotly / SciPy when needed)  
- **Eng tools:** CAD (e.g. SolidWorks / Fusion 360), LaTeX  
- **Other:** Git, Linux, Jupyter Notebooks

## 🌱 Currently learning

- More advanced **aerodynamic modelling** (drag breakdown, correlations, etc.)
- Better **software engineering practices** for scientific code (testing, structure, readability)
- Deepening my knowledge on useful **visualizations** for scientific projects

---

## 🤝 Open to

- Collaborating on **aerospace / physics / simulation** projects
- Contributing to **Python scientific libraries** or educational tools

## ⚡ Fun (aero) fact

> The Apollo 11 guidance computer had far less processing power than a modern smartphone or even a modern microcontroller, yet it still helped land humans on the Moon in 1969. Probably means there's no true limit to what we can do nowadays.
